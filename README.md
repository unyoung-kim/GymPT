People often lose track of timing their rest periods between each set of exercises. Setting up a timer on your phone after every set of workout is not only inconvenient but also easy to forget, which frustrate many disciplined lifters.

The application:
1) Counts the reps of different types of workouts using pose-detection (tensorflow-js)
2) Automatically sets up timers at the end of every sets

The application is designed to function like a personal trainare or a workout partner to help lifters have a more disciplined session in the gym.
